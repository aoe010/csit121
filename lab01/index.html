        <h2>The best Shawarma you will ever have!</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Lemon juice</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Olive oil</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Spices</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Mix marinade - </strong>For ease, simply prepare the marinade directly in a ziplock bag. This method is optimal as it ensures the chicken remains evenly coated. If you opt for a container instead, ensure to rotate the chicken occasionally or increase the marinade quantity by 50%.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Add chicken - </strong>Place the chicken pieces into the marinade. Seal the bag, removing any excess air, then gently massage from the outside to ensure thorough coating. Allow the chicken to marinate in the fridge for 12 to 24 hours. If you're short on time, even 3 hours will suffice!</li>
            
            <li><strong>Yogurt sauce - </strong>Prepare the yogurt sauce by combining the ingredients, then set it aside for at least 20 minutes to allow the flavors to blend. This sauce can be stored in the fridge for up to 3 days.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Cook chicken - </strong>You can cook it either on the stove or on the BBQ. It will develop a delicious crust from the spices, and you'll love the aromaâ€”it's irresistible!</li>

            <li><strong>Rest - </strong>Rest the chicken for a minimum of 3 minutes before serving to allow the juices to redistribute within the meat. Otherwise, they will leak out everywhere when you slice the chicken.</li>


        </ol>

        <p> I enjoy eating chicken shawarma for its flavorful and aromatic spices, tender and juicy meat, and the versatility it offers in serving options, such as wraps, sandwiches, or salads. Additionally, the cooking process often involves marinating the chicken, which enhances its flavor profile. Below i'm going to include a link to a website where i get all my recipes from.</p>
